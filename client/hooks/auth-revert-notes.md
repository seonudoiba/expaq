# Authentication Flow Reversion

Changes:
- Removed useAuthSync hook usage to simplify the authentication flow
- Updated ProtectedComponent to use direct auth store access
- Simplified AuthProvider implementation
- Maintained the same protection levels and access control
- Fixed continuous API calling issue

The approach now uses the original authentication pattern without the extra complexity.
